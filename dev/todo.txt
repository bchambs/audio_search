Ideas for future development which are too important to be lost in inlined 'TODO' comments


TASKS
    1. Add a scheduled task to check for echo nest api updates.  Email admin on update.
    2. Add scheduled task to update top artists on /music/

SERVICES
    1. Group service classes somehow.
    2. Move echo host / url stuff to echonest.py.
    3. Have 'seed' init args determine playlist type. seed=song


ECHONEST.py
    1. Add validate method to be executed before storing.  (check size, data type, etc. pass data type to cache.store ?)
    2. Create a response key generator (group + 's' if response data type is a list?)


GENERAL
    1. Add doc strings to exceptions.
    2. Generalize make_key and make_id.  
    3. Look into __getstate__ and __setstate__ when improving core/redis.py

OLD CODE
    1. preprocess.py can probably be improved / simplified with a django module.
