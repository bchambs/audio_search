to do:
~ handle individual echo nest api codes
~ refactor all imports to reduce overhead / have better namespace

the final site will have the following pages:

index
    1. search bar
    2. popular list (top 10 artists by echo nest rating)
        a) update this hourly with an async task
    3. trending list (top 10 searched artists / songs on audiosearch)
        a) add js to check for updates async
    4. about icon -> modal
    5. footer containing github / email (?)

artist
    1. main tab:
        a) bio summary: use wiki and only display first paragraph -> rest in modal
        b) terms
        c) rating (hotttnesss)
        d) images with title image (random ?)

    2. songs tab:
        a) first 15 songs obtained from initial call, more can be loaded asynchronously -> DJANGO PAGINATION

    3. similar artists tab:
        b) same as songs tab

song
    1. main tab:
        a) misc song facts

search
    1. artist and song result column with 'show more results' button to show respective result pages -> DJANGO PAGINATION

random:
need to see if an item can expire from cache between the following two lines:
    if RC.exists(request_id):
        data_str = RC.get(request_id)

this would throw an except because we are getting an item that expired 1 line above.  make it a block (?)
