This details project updates starting from 5/25/2014:

5/25/2014

1.  Replace the 'temp' list in remove_duplicate_artists and 
remove_duplicate_songs with a dictionary.  This slightly increases 
performance as object look up is now constant instead of O(len(temp)).

2.  Replace the 'temp' list in get_similar_songs with a dictionary (see above).

3.  Combine remove_duplicate_artists and remove_duplicate_songs into 
remove_duplicates.

4.  Fixed out of bounds exception when finding similar songs (queried artists 
did not have enough songs).

5.  Fixed forward reference error when displaying artists without similar artists.
