RULES
========
group:
    h1, h2, p {...}
        ... applied to h1, h2, p


block = takes up full width, line break before and after
inline: takes up minimum width, no line breaks

position:
    -HTML elements are positioned static by default.
    -Elements can be positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first.

    fixed = positioned relative to the browser window.  It will not move even if the window is scrolled:
    relative = positioned relative to its original position.
    absolute = An absolute position element is positioned relative to the first parent element that has a position other than static. If no such element is found, the containing block is <html>

float:
    clear = The clear property specifies which side(s) of an element other floating elements are not allowed.

horizontal aligning:
    -Block elements can be center-aligned by setting the left and right margins to "auto".
        Center-aligning has no effect if the width is 100%.

combinators:
    There are four different combinators in CSS3

    descendant selector = matches all element that are descendants of a specified element.
        div p {...}

    child selector = selects all elements that are the immediate children of a specified element.
        div > p {...}

    adjacent sibling selector = selects all elements that are the adjacent siblings of a specified element.
        div + p {...}

    general sibling selector = selects all elements that are siblings of a specified element.
        div ~p {...}

pseudo classes:
    ::before
        p::before {...}
    ::after

focus:
    The :focus selector is used to select the element that has focus.
        Tip: The :focus selector is allowed on elements that accept keyboard events or other user inputs.

attributes:
    css = [w] {background-color: yellow;} 
    html: div w="..."

    css = [class|="top"] {background-color: yellow;}
    html: <p class="top-text">Hello world!</p>

text:
    text-transform: capitalize;
    letter-spacing: 3px;
    word-spacing: 30px;
    vertical-align: text-top;

tables:
    border-collapse = The border-collapse property sets whether the table borders are collapsed into a single border or separated:
    
    caption-side: bottom;

outline:
    outline

random:
    cursor:wait

OTHER
========
The <br> element is an empty HTML element. It has no end tag.

Remember that browsers will always truncate spaces in HTML pages. If you write 10 spaces in your text, the browser will remove 9 of them. To add real spaces to your text, you can use the &nbsp; character entity.

links:
    The four links states are:

    a:link - a normal, unvisited link
    a:visited - a link the user has visited
    a:hover - a link when the user mouses over it
    a:active - a link the moment it is clicked

em:
    1em is equal to the current font size. The default text size in browsers is 16px. So, the default size of 1em is 16px.

    body {
        font-size: 100%;
    }
    h1 {
        font-size: 2.5em;
    }
    p {
        font-size: 0.875em;
    }

cascade order (4 = highest, 1 = lowest):
    1. Browser default
    2. External style sheet
    3. Internal style sheet (in the head section)
    4. Inline style (inside an HTML element)

overloading rules:
    
    margin: 25px 50px 75px 100px;
        top margin is 25px
        right margin is 50px
        bottom margin is 75px
        left margin is 100px

    margin: 25px 50px 75px;
        top margin is 25px
        right and left margins are 50px
        bottom margin is 75px

    margin: 25px 50px;
        top and bottom margins are 25px
        right and left margins are 50px

    margin: 25px;
        all four margins are 25px





The following tags can be added to the head section: <title>, <style>, <meta>, <link>, <script>, <noscript>, and <base>.


Inline elements:

    respect left & right margins and padding, but not top & bottom
    cannot have a width and height set
    allow other elements to sit to their left and right.

Block elements:

    respect all of those
    force a line break after the block element

Inline-block elements:

    allow other elements to sit to their left and right
    respect top & bottom margins and padding
    respect height and width
