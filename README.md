============

Web app created in Django.  Uses Echo Nest API to give music information and suggest similar artists / songs.  Below is my to-do list of features.

1. Develop algorithm to crop artist images so they do not appear stretched.  This will probably be done in javascript.

2. Develop algorithm to return meaningful artist biographies.  Current version is lacking.

3. Add footer div to fill page.

4. Add pagination for more artist / song results.

5. Combine remove_duplicate_artists and remove_duplicate_songs somehow.
