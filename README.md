============

Web app created in Django to be deployed with docker.  Uses Echo Nest API to give music information and suggest similar artists / songs.  Below is my todo list of features.

1. Develop algorithm to crop artist images so they do not appear stretched.  This will probably be done in javascript.

2. Develop algorithm to return meaningful artist biographies.  Current version is lacking.

3. Replace numbered lists with visually pleasing tables.

4. Add footer div to fill page.
